Welcome! I'm a passionate and analytical professional rooted in sunny San Diego, my hometown, where the waves of the Pacific are as much a part of me as my passion for tech. I love snorkeling and free diving, exploring a world beneath the waves that constantly ignites my curiosity. When on land, I enjoy hiking with my four-legged companion Tada the dog and expressing my creativity through music, strumming on my guitar, and occasionally leading music in church.
<br>
My unique life journey has cultivated an out-of-the-box approach that permeates every decision I make. My passion for technology was ignited at a young age, sparked by a love for fantasy that led me to the exciting world of graphic and website design as a preteen. I pursued my interest in computer applications and programming with classes in high school, but actually lost touch with this passion while I became more involved in hobbies such as surfing. My love of the natural world propelled me into traversing by backpack, camping in enchanting bioregions across the United States. Fueled by a love of nature, I spent time in conservation and even a season in Wildland Fire fighting.
<br>
In reemerging from forests, I brought my resilience, resourcefulness, and teamwork skills learned from backpacking into the corporate world. My wide-ranging professional experience includes customer support, IT analysis, and domain services. These roles demanded high organziational skills, keen attention to detail, excellent communication, and leadership, which I was readily able to deliver.
<br>
I quickly found success, gaining promotions and exceeding expectations in every role. My analytical and numbers-driven mindset thrives on creating effective workflows and quanifying objectives to bridge the gap between the current stage and our goals.
<br>
Presently, my journey finds me navigating the challenging waters of Trust & Safety in the domain name industry. I focus on fraud and DNS abuse prevention, formulating strategies and enhancing procedures that have significantly reduced chargebacks and abuse cases. My mission is to not only create secure spaces in the digital world but also to educate others about it. My vision it to produce a YouTube series equipping internet users with knowledge on DNS, email, and website forensics, enabling them to identify and report abuse more effectively.
<br>
So here I am, still fueled by the same curiosity and thirst for learning that sparked my early adventures in both the natural and digital world. My story continues to evolve, blending adventure, creativity, and determination, as we journey together into the future.
